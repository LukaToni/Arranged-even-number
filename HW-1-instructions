Write a program to edit the sequence of numbers given even numbers in ascending order and odd numbers leave it alone. 
The program should first read the length of the sequence (up to 100), then each number. 
Example: The contents of the input 

7 4 3 6 4 1 2 9 

means that the numbers in the sequence of 7, this being the number of the line 4, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2 and 9 

The program must write the rearranged sequence, but without length: 

2 3 4 1 4 6 9 

So odd numbers remain in their places of even numbers are arranged in ascending order.
The numbers should be separated by spaces, the last number is followed by a space character and 
the character to jump on a new line.
